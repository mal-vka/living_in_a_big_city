## description
This is a result of **first steps in learning HTML and CSS**. To reconstructed this simple site template (originally created by [The Awwwesomes](https://theawwwesomes.org/)), I used:
- flex, pseudoelements - for the arrangement of elements
- the BEM methodology - for clear references
- CSS custom properties - to facilitate setting global values for a project (eg. color, fonts)
- media querries - so that my simple template may be responsive
